Step - 1: Data Collection
--------------------------
--> In this Project, We need to collect images of players. There are 4 ways of doing it.
	-->Download images manually from chrome and then use them to train the model.
	--> Use web scrapping code to automatically download images from chrome. link for article - https://towardsdatascience.com/image-scraping-with-python-a96feda8af2d
	--> Use of FATKUN Chrome tool -- It's a chrome extension that we will be using.
	--> Buy Images from 3rd party vendor

--> Github link for google image scrapping code: https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/DataScience/CelebrityFaceRecognition/google_image_scrapping/image_download.py
	IMP NOTE - It may not work because google keep on changing code to prevent web scrapping


Step-2: Data Cleaning
-----------------------
--> Most of the time is spent on data cleaning. 
-->Requirements:
	1) Eyes must be visible. If 2 eyes clearly visible then keep it else discard it.
	2)Photos must be clear

For FACE_DETECTION:
-------------------
->We will be using OPENCV - Opencv is famous image processing library in python
-> For Detection, we will be using HAAR-CASCADE TECHNIQUE - Famous technique to detect eyes and face.
->80% of data cleaning will be done by Automated code, while 20% data cleaning will  be done MANUALLY REJECTION -- means deleting unwanted images or images of other person in same photo.


Step-3: Let's Begin Working on the Project Step by Step
--------------------------------------------------------
1) Put Images separately in one folder <Name wise>
2) Download the Requirements inside 'model' folder. List of requirements is inside 'requirement.txt' file.
3) Step to install requirements is - Open model folder -> open cmd prompt from here -> type- 'pip install -r requirements.txt' -> press enter
4) Open jupyter notebook inside 'model' folder
5)Import libraries
6) Convery colorful image into greyscale image.
7) Use HAAR CASCADE Method for face Detection -->Also read article on how it works...Very IMP for Interview.
8) Code on How to use HAAR CASCADE Method--> You will get it on website itself
9) You Have 'HAAR CASCADE Files/code' inside 'opencv' folder. They are pre-trained classifiers.
10) Whatever processing we have done on image is there in jupyter notebook. Read the COMMENTS.
11) Write code to get cropped images from original images and store in folder
12) Delete unwanted images from cropped folder
13) Now we will do WAVELENGTH TRANSFORMATION --> It is used to extract important features from image. It is the most effective way of extracting feature like eyes, forehead, lips, nose etc.
14) We are creating vertical stack of Raw image and wavelength transformation image.
15) we will be using SVM as a classification model. It is very effective in classification.
16) We will train multiple models and will take the model which shows the best result.







Important Questions Related to this Project:
---------------------------------------------
1) Why we are using greyscale image?
2) What are other image processing libraries ang face detection technique.
3) what are other feature extraction technique?- like wavelength transformation
